# Meier

Meier is a small tool to match pupils to events/groups according to their
preferences (green, yellow, red).

The name is borrowed from a class game where all pupils get cards with different
spelling of the common German family name Meier (like Meyer, Maier, Mair, Meir
and so on) and should find their mates with the same spelling all at the same
time.
